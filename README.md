Some quick code to help out a small business with invoicing
- program creates a GUI to fill out invoices for the business' clients 
- it is called from the command line in the above directory
- it takes command line arguements for the invoice month and year
- needed files include template word (docx) files for how the invoice should look in addition to a template excel (xlts) file for the data that should be read in
- I use the tkinter module in Python to build the GUI
- this is the first time I've built and worked with GUIs in Python, so imporvements will continue to be made
